Zigzi : Binary rewriting framework for Windows executable format. (PE)
=======================================================================

## *About Zigzi*
Zigzi is currently in prototyping. only for proof of concept.

## *Introduce*
Jigzi is the world's oldest extant book printed with movable metal type. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jikji).

The name zigzi comes from Jikji.

The recent exploit exploit is 95% ROP, and mitigation techniques are being studied. However, such defenses must go through a difficult and complex process of instrumenting a binary or rewriting a binary itself.
Zigzi integrates these complex and difficult processes into one framework to help researchers study techniques and techniques to purely mitigate ROP without the architectural differences between x86 and ARM and the difficulty of OS differences such as Windows and Linux do.

## *Project Goal*
we develope framework for research and apply practical and advanced CFI(Control Flow Integrity) techniques to PE format.
